# GreenBot
My first hackathon!
GreeBot is a small DIY system. We read data from simple sensors (soil moisture, light, temperature) and show tips on a small screen and a web dashboard. This makes it easier to know when and how to care for each plant, which improves plant survival and indoor air quality.
